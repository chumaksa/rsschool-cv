## About me
I have a specialized higher education in the field of IT. After graduating from the institute, my first job was related to programming, maintenance and configuration of fire alarm systems, access control systems and automated energy metering systems.

My next job was in an outsourcing IT company. My career has been going well. Within two years I had two promotions. I was engaged in technical user support and server administration. Gradually, the work became monotonous and I wanted to slightly change the direction of activity in the IT field. I was attracted to website development.

I started my own business as a Sole Proprietor. I made websites, supported them and promoted them on the Internet. But after a while I realized that it is impossible to do everything at the same time. My skill development has stopped. I decided to give up site support, SEO and concentrate directly on web development and grow up as a middle frontend developer. My ultimate goal is to become a full stack javascript developer.
